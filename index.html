        <p>
            My goal for this course is to be better at planning and 
            learning web development fundamentals while learning how 
            project management principles apply to real technical tasks 
            like for example at work. I also want to improve my ability 
            to plan projects before jumping into coding.
        </p>

        <p>
            Professionally, I would like to work in a place that mixes both technology 
            and creativity. By combining my skills in programming, media production, and project management, I hope to work on projects that allow me to create meaningful and engaging digital content that can reach as many people as possible.
